GPSToggler
==========

GPS toggle widget for Android rooted devices

Versions:

0.15
----

Added two passive activities: 'OnActivity' and 'OffActivity'.
Those two used to automate GPS on/off from 3rd party applications.

Added 'GPSActivityTest' application as an example of above.


0.14
----

Implemented fully automatic uninstall for the system module. 

'SU' utilization is minimized. The application asks for the 'SU' permission only once during the first run.

Implemented the 'SU' bypass algorithm (own local 'SU') to minimize the user bothering. 


0.13
----

Implemented semi-automatic uninstall for the system module.


Before 0.13
-----------

Early public releases.
